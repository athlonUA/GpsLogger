/// 2D constant-velocity Kalman filter over the accepted-fix stream.
///
/// Layered between `LocationFilter.accept` and `StationaryDetector.consume`,
/// so outlier rejection has already run by the time the smoother sees a
/// sample, and stationary decisions read post-smoothing coordinates. The
/// goal is purely cosmetic-but-measurable: at HA=32 m in partial-sky
/// conditions the bare chip output scatters by ±30 m around the true
/// position, producing visible zigzag on the map. Averaging consecutive
/// samples through a constant-velocity motion prior reduces per-sample
/// position variance roughly by √N across the sliding smoothing window
/// without distorting sharp turns the way a coordinate-space moving
/// average would.
///
/// State vector: `[x, y, vx, vy]` in meters / m·s⁻¹, expressed in a local
/// East-North-Up frame anchored at the first accepted fix (`origin`).
/// Working in local meters sidesteps the lat/cos-scaling arithmetic traps
/// of filtering in degrees and makes the process-noise covariance Q a
/// plain function of an acceleration standard deviation in SI units.
///
/// Motion model: constant velocity with discrete white-noise acceleration
/// (DWNA). Q is parameterized by `processAccelStdDev`, modelling the
/// unmodelled acceleration a real walker / cyclist / motorist can produce
/// between samples. The chosen default (~1 m/s²) is a conservative
/// multi-modal compromise: low enough to smooth HA-bucket quantization
/// noise on a steady walk, high enough that sharp turns and cyclist
/// starts/stops do not produce visible phase lag.
///
/// Measurement model: position only. The filter intentionally ignores
/// `CLLocation.speed` and `.course` — they are useful but noisy at low
/// speeds, and fusing them would require separate variance tuning per
/// transport mode. Velocity is retained implicitly through successive
/// position observations. Measurement noise R uses CLLocation's reported
/// `horizontalAccuracy` directly as σ — Apple's own quality estimate,
/// which the filter trusts as-is.
///
/// Reset policy:
///   - First fix: initialize state to the measurement, velocity to zero,
///     position covariance to σ²_m, velocity covariance to a conservative
///     large value so the first few updates can adapt quickly.
///   - `dt > resetGapSeconds`: re-initialize. After a long gap the
///     cached velocity estimate is meaningless (we have no evidence of
///     what the user did during the gap), so it is safer to anchor fresh
///     than to predict across minutes of unknown movement.
///   - `dt ≤ 0`: re-initialize defensively (out-of-order delivery should
///     have been caught upstream, but the filter must not divide by zero
///     or accumulate backwards in time).
///
/// Output `CLLocation`:
///   - `coordinate` = filtered lat/lon (converted back from ENU meters)
///   - `timestamp` = identical to input
///   - `altitude`, `verticalAccuracy`, `speed`, `course`, `speedAccuracy`,
///     `courseAccuracy` copied from input unchanged. These are not part
///     of the horizontal Kalman state; distorting them would desync them
///     from what the chip actually reported without providing any
///     horizontal quality benefit.
///   - `horizontalAccuracy` = RMS of the post-update position covariance
///     diagonal, so downstream consumers that reason about accuracy see
///     an honest improved quality estimate. After a few updates this is
///     strictly ≤ the input σ.
